#Data Types

#String

#important to remember programmers always start with 0 because we work with binary
#H=0 e=1 l=2 l=3 l=4
print("Hello"[4])

"123"
#if you printed "123+456" it wouldnt work as a sum the computer reads it as a String
print("123"+"345")

#integer = programming lingo for whole numbers, numbers without decimal places.

print ( 123 + 345) #makes a calculation because it is not trying to read a string. 

123_456_789 #interger's replace comma's for large intergers with underscores. Computer will ignore it, the underscore benefits us to read it.

#Float....floating point number (when you include a decimal)

3141.59

#Boolean - True or False, always begin with caps for these 

True
False
